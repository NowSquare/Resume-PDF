Technical help with features or server related configurations is beyond the scope of this script. There is a lot of information available on the internet on how work with these frameworks.

Upload the files in this directory to the webroot of your hosting account. The script must be installed on a top level domain or subdomain. For instance example.com or sub.example.com. Sub-directories like example.com\/resume are not supported. If you want to test on your localhost you have to create a host file entry like resume.test. It will not work on urls like 127.0.0.0\/resume. Run installation Open the url where you have installed the script. You should see a screen as follows: Follow the installation steps and the script will be installed in the last step. Execute permission If you use a Windows server (also WAMP server and other local development tools), you don't need to configure anything in most cases. If you can't download a PDF, give execute permission to vendor\\wemersonjanuario\\wkhtmltopdf-windows\\bin\\64bit\\wkhtmltopdf.exe. For Unix based systems, set vendor\/h4cc\/wkhtmltopdf-amd64\/bin\/wkhtmltopdf-amd64 to 774. Troubleshooting Logs If you run into a 500 or other error, check the logs in storage\/logs. Send us a support message if you are not sure what the logs mean. Reinstall If you want to reinstall the script, just remove the .env file from the webroot.

No, not without modifying the source code. We opted for an approach in which we pre-defined the most common pages in order to make adjustments as easy as possible.

How can I see what is the latest version? Is this a SaaS script? How can I change the content? How can I add or modify languages? What kind of support is included? Can I request a feature? Will you update the script? Can I get a discount? Can I get a refund? How can I see which version I have? If you log in as the admin, you will see the version number on the dashboard. How can I see what is the latest version? The changelog will show the latest version and all changes. Is this a SaaS script? One of the goals is to keep the app 100% independent from third parties. The script is multi-user, but since the goal is to create brand awareness, all accounts are free. However, it is possible to manually set a user account to Premium. Premium accounts have less limitations and no referrer link in the footer. There are no plans to implement subscriptions or payment providers. How can I change the content? See content customization. How can I add or modify languages? See translation customization. What kind of support is included? We are happy to help you with technical questions about features. If things don't work as expected, or if you run into any bugs, please let us know and we will try to solve the issue as soon as possible. Support does NOT include the following: We cannot provide general webhosting and\/or general PHP support. We cannot provide general Laravel support. We cannot help with issues from your own customization. We cannot provide customizations that extended default Business Manager features. What you see in demo is what comes with your purchase. We cannot provide how-to advice on if Business Manager is capable of doing what you want\/need. Read documentation and try demo to determine if it will suit your needs. We cannot provide fixes that are unique to your web hosting or server environment. If your hosting or server environment is different than what is listed in requirements section, you'll need to determine if it will work before purchasing. We try for fast response times but as described on our support tab, response time may be up to 2 business days. Too many issue\/feature questions that do not fall under support will slow down all response times. Please investigate for yourself thoroughly before contacting us. Other notes and considerations: If you found a bug feel free to report but first check if there in new version available. Before asking questions, please search the comments area. Questions may have already been answered. Before asking questions, please check the documentation. Before asking questions, please check the FAQ's. If you are experiencing installation problem please open a support ticket. You can be assisted while your server meets the Business Manager requirements. Please do not ask for a free licence. We appreciate help but will not compensate for it. Please dont ask for support on the comments sections. Usualy you will get the answer &quot;Please open a support ticket&quot;. If your support is expired, before asking questions consider renewing it. You cannot get a refund once the item has been downloaded under any circumstances. Can I request a feature? You can always indicate which features you would like to see. We highly appreciate user input. This does not mean that it is technically possible or feasible to build in these feature(s), or that we will build it in within a certain time. We may consider feature requests, but understand that seemingly simple updates can be technically challenging due to design choices made during the development process. Product development is time-consuming. Features may sound easy because they are easy to grasp, but can be complex to implement while keeping everything backwards-compatible. Will you update the script? We have created this script and we have the intention to update it regularly. Of course, we can't make hard promises, but as long as the financial compensation allows, we intend to work on this project. Can I get a discount? We believe that the price should be fair. It's already as low as possible, so discount is not meaningful. Can I get a refund? You cannot get a refund once the item has been downloaded under any circumstances. There is an online demo where you can test all features, and you can ask questions before making the purchase.","tags":"","url":"Frequently_Asked_Questions.html"}]}
