Styles (CSS) and JavaScript are managed and compiled with Node Package Manager and Webpack. All source files are included. There is no manual how to create new features, but since Laravel is used for the back-end and Vuetify for the front-end, you can study these frameworks to get a good understanding. Technical help with features or server related configurations is beyond the scope of this script. There is a lot of information available on the internet on how work with these frameworks. The front-end Vue files are located in the resources\/frontend directory.

Upload the files in this directory to the webroot of your hosting account. The script must be installed on a top level domain or subdomain. For instance example.com or sub.example.com. Sub-directories like example.com\/resume are not supported. If you want to test on your localhost you have to create a host file entry like resume.test. It will not work on urls like 127.0.0.0\/resume. Set permission After uploading, make sure all files in the directory resources\/wkhtmltopdf are executable (CHMOD 774). Install script Open the url where you have installed the script. You should see a screen as follows: Follow the installation steps and the script will be installed in the last step. Troubleshooting I can't download a PDF In most cases, this is because of a wrong web server distro configuration. Open the .env file in your webroot and test the different options for the WEB_SERVER configuration. If your web server distro is not listed, check if it exists in this this list. Logs If you run into a 500 or other error, check the logs in storage\/logs. Reinstall If you want to reinstall the script, just remove the .env file from the webroot. Make sure the .env.example file exists, do not rename it, it will be copied during the installation.","tags":"","url":"Technical_Documentation\/Installation\/Install_the_script.html"},{"title":"How to update","text":"Find your current version Download Zip Extract files No need to update at first installation Find your current version When you log in as admin, you will see the version number on the dashboard.

You can simply overwrite the files of your installation with the update files, it doesn't matter which version the Zip or your installation has. The incremental-update-x.x.x.zip file contains a htdocs directory. Extract the files in that directory to the root directory of your Resume PDF installation. No need to update at first installation The contents of the Zip file you download always has the latest version in the public directory.

Only if you have already installed the script and want to update to a newer version.","tags":"","url":"Technical_Documentation\/Installation\/How_to_update.html"},{"title":"Content","text":"Can I add pages? No, not without modifying the source code. We opted for an approach in which we pre-defined the most common pages in order to make adjustments as easy as possible.
